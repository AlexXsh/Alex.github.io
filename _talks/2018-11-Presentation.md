Detecting and tracking moving targets with video surveillance systems is challenging, especially when using a moving camera. Conventional algorithms using projective transformation and frame differencing are inaccurate and slow. A new algorithm that combines a type of optical flow and color features is proposed to improve both detection accuracy in and tracking speed. Case studies of a variety of complex scenarios were conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.
