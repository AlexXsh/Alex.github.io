This course  will  provide senior undergraduate  and  graduate  students  from  a diverse engineering disciplines with fundamental concepts,  principlesand toolsto extract and generalize knowledge from data. Students will acquire an integrated set of skills spanning data processing, statistics andmachine learning,along with a good understanding of the synthesis of these skills and their applications to solving problem. The course is composed of a systematic introduction of the fundamentaltopics of data science study, including: (1) principles of data processing and representation, (2) theoretical basis and advances in data  science,(3) modeling  and algorithms,and (4) evaluation  mechanisms. The emphasis  in  the  treatment of these topics  will  be  given  to  the  breadth,  rather  than  the  depth. Real-world  engineering problems  and  data  will  be  used  as  examples to  illustrate  and  demonstrate  the  advantages  and disadvantages  of  different  algorithms  and  compare  their  effectiveness  as  well  as  efficiency,and  help students to understand and identify the circumstances under which the algorithms are most ap
