About me
======
Welcome to my personal website!

My name Yinwei Zhang. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona. The University of Arizona locates at Tucson, south-western U.S.. It is dry and the temperature during the summer is crazy here, so all we have is Saguaro here.   

I have been in the University of Arizona for 7 years. I first came here as a master's student, then I started to persue my Ph.D degree in the Sytems and Industrial Engineering. This department is famous for its operational reseach and quality engineering. I also started to get another master's degree in the Department of Statistics and Data Scientist. I passed the qualifying exam with a Ph.D. level pass held by Department of Statistics and Data Scientist and I am expected to get my second master degree in the coming winter. 

From Jan/2021 to Aug/2022, I became a research intern in ABB and spent 1.5 years in using TensorFlow and PyTorch and applied deep learning algorithms in real world industrial applications. At the begining of the internship, a lot of problems occurred when I was working the project due to the pandemic. The project was lack of data and lack of hardware. However, with the help from my project manager, we started to make progress. At the end of the internship, I worked with my project manager and the lawyer team in ABB and we summerized the work I had done into several patents. These patents are now under filing.

Besides my work, I enjoy music and I love playing guitar whenever I am available. My favorite guitarist is Slash. Luckly, I had a chance to watch the concert held by Guns N' Roses in Phoenix, AZ. Slash played like a killer.

Thank you!
