About me
======
Welcome to my personal website!

My name Yinwei Zhang. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona. The University of Arizona locates at Tucson, south-western U.S.. It is dry and the temperature during the summer is crazy here, so all we have is Saguaro here.   

I have been in the University of Arizona for 7 years. I first came here as a master's student in the department of Systems and Industrial Engineering. This department is famous for its operational reseach and quality engineering. After I got my master degree, I started to persue my Ph.D degree in Industrial Engineering. During my Ph.D. career, I focused on quality control, anomaly detection in high dimensional data by using statistics and machine learning knowledge. Since my research area is so close to statistics, I also started to pursue another master's degree in the Department of Statistics and Data Science since 2020. In this August (Aug/2022), I passed the qualifying exam with a Ph.D. level pass held by Department of Statistics and Data Scientist and I am expected to get my second master degree in the winter (Dec/2022). 

From Jan/2021 to Aug/2022, I became a research intern in ABB and spent 1.5 years in using TensorFlow and PyTorch and applied deep learning algorithms in real world industrial applications. At the begining of the internship, a lot of problems occurred when I was working the project, such as limited data and limited hardware due to the due to the pandemic. However, with the help from my project manager, we started to make significant progress. At the end of the internship, I worked with my project manager and the lawyer team in ABB and we summerized the work I had done into several patents. These patents are now under filing.

Besides my work, I enjoy music and I love playing guitar whenever I am available. My favorite guitarist is Slash. Luckly, I had a chance to watch the concert held by Guns N' Roses in Phoenix, AZ. Slash played like a killer.

These are all about myself. I am very glad that you read through these materials. thank you!
