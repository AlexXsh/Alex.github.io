About me
======
Welcome to my personal website!

My name Yinwei Zhang. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona majoring in Industrial Engineering. The University of Arizona locates at Tucson, south-western America. The weather is super dry and the temperature is crazy here during the summer , so we don't have many green trees but saguaro cactus here.   

I have been studying in the University of Arizona for 7 years. I first came here as a master's student in the department of Systems and Industrial Engineering. This department is famous for its operation reseach and quality engineering. After I got my master degree, I started to persue my Ph.D degree in Industrial Engineering. During my Ph.D. career, I focused on spatial-temporal modeling and anomaly detection in high dimensional data by using statistics and machine learning knowledge. Since my research area is closely related to statistics, I pursued another master's degree in the Department of Statistics and Data Science since 2020. In this August (Aug/2022), I passed the qualifying exam with a Ph.D. level pass held by the Department of Statistics and Data Science and I am expected to get my second master degree in the winter (Dec/2022). 

From Jan/2021 to Aug/2022, I worked as a research intern in ABB, Raleigh. The main tasks for me were applying deep learning algorithms in real world industrial applications by using TensorFlow and PyTorch. At the begining of the internship, due to the pandemic, obstacles occurred such as limited data and limited hardware resources. However, with the help from my project manager, we began to make significant progress. At the end of the internship, the achievements I made were summerized into several patents which are now under filing.

After my internship, I came back to the campus. Now, I am working on several projects such as evaluating the safety of the autonomou vehicle and detecting anomalies in videos, and more importantly, my dissertation.

Besides my work, I really enjoy music and playing guitar. My favorite guitarist is Slash. Luckily, I had a chance to watch a Guns N' Roses' concert in Phoenix, AZ. Slash played like a killer. I also like photography and I will bring my camera whevener I visit a new place.

These are all about me. I am very glad that you read through all of these, thank you!
