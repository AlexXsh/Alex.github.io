About me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate with 1.5 years of industrial experience in machine learning and 5 years Ph.D. research experience in statistical modeling with a variety of programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, and R. My research is mainly about anomly detection with interpretable statistical modeling in high dimensional data, especially anomaly detection for image and video. Besides this, I spent 1.5 years in using TensorFlow and PyTorch and applied deep learning algorithms in real world industrial applications when I was doing my internship. I also proposed several methods to improve the existing deep learning pipeline and these have been summarized into patents and have been submitted.
